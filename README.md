# Just-a-coffee-website-project
Im going to be honest ,  I have received a lot of help in this project by using AI, cus im running out of time for other activities.
Even though i used ai for this, It will never be perfect. 
I also spent a lot of time debugging and fixing ai mistakes.

For the one using this feel free to edit or add something its not a complete website, just some basic html,css and javascript.
It might seem basic but it can get you somewhere.


If you have any tips to help me improve thanks!
I dont know what to add after this but i want to say thank you for having the time to read this and help<3
I hope this helps!!
